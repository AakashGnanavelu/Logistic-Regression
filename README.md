# Logistic-Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used in machine learning to predict the probability of an event occurring. It is commonly used to solve classification problems, which involve assigning a label or category to a new observation based on a set of input features.

Imagine you have a dataset of student grades and you want to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on factors such as the amount of time they spent studying, their attendance record, and their previous grades. Logistic regression can help you to model the relationship between these variables and the probability of passing the exam.

In logistic regression, the output or dependent variable is binary, which means it can only take two values, such as pass or fail. The input or independent variables are used to predict the output variable. The logistic regression model calculates the probability of the output variable based on the input variables.

The logistic regression model produces a curve that shows the relationship between the input variables and the probability of the output variable. The curve is called the logistic function or sigmoid function. The curve starts at zero and increases smoothly to one as the input variable increases. The midpoint of the curve represents the probability of the output variable being one or zero.

Once the model is trained on a dataset, it can be used to predict the probability of the output variable for new observations. If the probability is above a certain threshold, the model will predict a positive outcome, and if it is below the threshold, it will predict a negative outcome.

Overall, logistic regression is a powerful tool for solving classification problems and predicting the probability of an event occurring based on input variables.
